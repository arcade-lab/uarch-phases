\section{Conclusion}

This study has shown different characteristics of SFG phases and applied SFG phases to DVFS. Controls for various parameters such as the interval size, similarity threshold, and model impact the phase length, number of phase transitions as well as the phase coverage. The interval size significantly impacts the phase length and transition. The similarity threshold effects all three phase characteristics. Finally, the interval model effects phase length and coverage. Phase detection tools should allow the client maximum flexibility to tune these parameters to generate the phase characteristics that fit the best for their overall needs. 

As the DVFS study show, the interval size is a significant parameter to factor in as it results in very different performance degradation to power savings ratios at different interval sizes. Other clients may find useful configuration of a different set of parameters. In addition to DVFS, we think that other potential application areas to explore for SFG phases includes anomaly detection, clock gating, and performance monitoring. Based on the findings in the current study, we believe that these applications and possibly others can fully exploit SFG phases to generate dynamically secure, performance, and power efficient code executions.
